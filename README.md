# Trendify

Small static e-commerce front-end.

Files:
- HTML files at project root (index.html, product.html, cart.html, etc.)
- CSS in `css/`
- JS in `js/`
- Images in `images/`

How to open locally:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser, or serve via a static file server such as `Live Server` in VS Code.

Next steps:
- If you want to push to GitHub, create a remote repo and run `git remote add origin <URL>` then `git push -u origin main`.
- Update Git user name/email with `git config user.name "Your Name"` and `git config user.email "you@example.com"` if needed.
